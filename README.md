# GenAI Setup

This is a basic GenAI aaplication that has been developed to understand how Generative AI model works.

Modules such as google.generative ai & streamlit are being used.

Google's Generative AI -- " gemini-2.5-flash-lite " is being used over here to create this model.

It has been deployed using streamlit.
